Since the memory files are too big to share them within this repository, you can download them from [here](https://cloud.hzdr.de/s/sBAL6GzTtJitJtW).
To get access to the files, you will need to enter this code: qi3u2oAFW
Download and unpack the memory files here and load them with the code provided in the notebook to recreate (almost) the same results as in the thesis.
You can also just create your own memory files with the provided function.

If you encounter any problems with the file download, please contact me!
